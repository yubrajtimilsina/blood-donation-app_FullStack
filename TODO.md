# Hospital Chat Implementation - TODO

## Backend Changes ✅
- [x] Add public hospital search endpoints (`getAllHospitalsPublic`, `searchHospitalsNearby`)
- [x] Update hospital routes to include public endpoints
- [x] Recreate hospital controller with proper structure

## Frontend Changes ✅
- [x] Create `SearchHospitals.jsx` page (similar to SearchDonors)
- [x] Update `FloatingChatWidget.jsx` to navigate to `/recipient/search-hospitals`
- [x] Add SearchHospitals import and route in `App.jsx`

## Testing & Verification
- [x] Backend server starts without errors
- [ ] Test hospital search functionality (requires frontend testing)
- [ ] Test hospital chat initiation (requires frontend testing)
- [ ] Verify backend endpoints work correctly (requires API testing)
- [ ] Check UI responsiveness and styling (requires frontend testing)

## Notes
- Hospital search supports both name/address search and location-based search
- Chat functionality reuses existing ChatModal component
- Follows same pattern as donor search for consistency
